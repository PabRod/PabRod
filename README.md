### Who am I?

Hi! This is Pablo Rodríguez. I work as a [Research Software Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_software_engineering) at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). Before that, I graduated in theoretical physics, worked for three years in the optical industry, and got a PhD in applied mathematics. The latter, with the thesis [Cycles and interactions: a mathematician among biologists](https://doi.org/10.18174/520571).

Additionally, I've been doing professional [science communication](https://pabrod.github.io/pages/sci-comm-en.html#sci-comm) since 2011.
